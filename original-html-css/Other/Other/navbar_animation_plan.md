# Plan for Navbar Animations

This document outlines the plan to add animations to the navigation bar to improve user experience.

## 1. Navigation Link Hover Effect
Add a subtle but clear visual cue when a user hovers over the "Artists" and "Commissions" links. This will be an animated underline that smoothly appears from the center outwards.

## 2. Button Hover Effects
- **Login Button**: Add a transition so that when hovered, its background color changes to the primary black color, and the text becomes white.
- **Register Button**: Add a hover effect that slightly darkens its background.

## 3. Active Navigation State
Add a style for an "active" link to indicate the user's current location. This will involve a bolder font weight and a persistent underline. This will require JavaScript for full implementation, but the CSS will be prepared.

## 4. Sticky Navigation on Scroll
Make the navigation bar "stick" to the top of the screen as the user scrolls down. A soft box-shadow and a semi-transparent background will be added to the header when it's in the "sticky" state.
